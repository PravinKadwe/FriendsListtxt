Hello Everyone,
      This Project demonstrates gathering data from the .txt file displayed in the dropdown, and the selected option from the dropdown list will be displayed below in the text box. After the selection is done click on the "Save Friend list" button which will create the "MyFriends.txt" file and the selected name will be saved in it.
